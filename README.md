## How to Use Combine Extensions

### Sink To Function Reference 

Prevent retain cycles by sinking to a function reference on a weakly retained object.

```swift
// Good
publisher
    .sink(to: CartViewModel.handleEvent, on: self, ownership: .weak) // Safely captured!
    .store(in: &subscriptions)
    
// Bad
publisher
    .sink(to: self.handleEvent) // `self` captured in subscription, causing retain cycle.
    .store(in: &subscriptions)
```
